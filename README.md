### Hello there! I'm James 👨‍💻 👋

I'm a software engineer and developer who's passionate about innovation, learning new tech and converting coffee into code. I build projects and applications that make an impact by improving processes, making things more efficient, or simply doing good. My stack mainly includes React and Gatsby for frontend 🖌, Firebase, Python, Django, and REST APIs for backend 📊, and AWS, Netlify, and Firebase Services (Hosting, Storage, Functions) for deployment and content management 🚀. 

💊 I'm currently working at a [Health Tech Startup](https://medgrocer.com) as an Associate IT Manager and Full Stack Developer.
